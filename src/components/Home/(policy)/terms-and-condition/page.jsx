              Welcome to Multisports. Before placing an order, please read the terms & conditions carefully. Please note that Multisports Ltd. reserves all the rights to change the terms & conditions and it can be changed anytime.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl text-gray-600 font-semibold md:font-bold mb-4">Product Availability:</h2>
            <p className="mb-9">
              We inform you that our featured items have limited quantities. Most of the products displayed on our website are also available at our outlets till products are in stock. Because of the limited availability, the nature of production, and technical issues, stock cannot be updated automatically. Due to all these reasons, we currently do not have the opportunity to automatically update our stock, but we are working on developing automatic stock updates. At this moment, we are updating stock manually in a specific timely manner. In such cases, even if the product appears on the website, the delivery may be disrupted.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl text-gray-600 font-semibold md:font-bold mb-4">Pricing Policy:</h2>
            <p className="mb-9">
              The prices displayed on the website are quoted in Bangladeshi Currency (BDT), including VAT and tax. In the case of a pricing mismatch due to system malfunction, Multisports Ltd. reserves the right to cancel any order anytime. Please note, online and outlet product prices can sometimes differ according to our promotional activities.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl text-gray-600 font-semibold md:font-bold mb-4">Order Policy:</h2>
            <p className="mb-9">
              Once an order is placed by the customer, it will be confirmed by us within the next working day. After that, we will proceed with shipping, following our shipping policy. Multisports Ltd. reserves the right to cancel the order based on product availability, and in the case of advance payment, customers will be refunded following our refund policy. Once the order is confirmed, the customer cannot cancel the order for both Cash on Delivery (COD) and prepaid payment orders.

              We offer home delivery services within Dhaka city and outside Dhaka. Customers can also collect the products from the nearest courier hub. Maximum delivery time is 3-5 working days within Dhaka Metropolitan and 7-10 working days outside Dhaka (Delivery time may vary according to government policies, weather calamities, and unforeseen circumstances). As we engage with courier partners for product delivery, the delivery process is not entirely under our control. If the product is damaged or lost for any reason, we will take appropriate action considering the circumstances.
